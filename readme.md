# Halloween Rush

This is a game made for the Halloween dress code competion.
It was made in pygame and took around 4 weeks to make so I
apologise for any bugs. to run the game scroll to the releases
section, install and extract **ALL** files in the game_files.zip, then
run the main.exe file

how to play:
the aim of the game is to survive as long as possible without
touching the ghosts or falling off. As the theme of the competition 
was to include a skeleton the main character is one.

movemnt:
the arrow keys and WASD move the skeleton
